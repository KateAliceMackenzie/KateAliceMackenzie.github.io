                            In most writing endeavours, and certainly in English school exams, writers are expected to describe scenes rich with detail. The best writing may use the environment to reflect the mood or deeper themes of the story. Many younger students find this a tricky skill to cultivate; it relies on understanding the role of metaphor as a cognitive process and as a cultural phenomenon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PixelVerse helps writers to practice and build this knowledge by generating the scenes they describe with pixel illustrations. It works both as visual feedback to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of their writing, and also as a way of inviting them to consider using the environment to add deeper meaning and to enrich the experience of the world they build.

                        <p>
                            This web mockup is designed to replicate the basic functionality of the mobile PixelVerse app and to demonstrate the 400 individual illustration assets required to create a truly personalised experience. It is lacking some of the additional content, visuals, animation and music of the fully realised concept. However, it will allow you to generate over 2,000,000 different scenes and give you a flavour of the scale and potential of this project.
